## Summary

My dissertation for a PhD in Biostatistics. The finalized document was
officially accepted by UC Berkeley's Graduate Division on 29 July 2021.

This repository is for archival purposes. All of the files required to build the
PDF yourself (wait, why!?) are included in this repository. Files necessary to
reproduce the simulation studies and data analyses in the various chapters of
the document are not yet available -- just the results are available. It's
possible that I will get around to fixing this after a much-needed vacation.

__The document is available (in PDF)
[here](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~nhejazi/publications/thesis-phd-biostat.pdf).__
