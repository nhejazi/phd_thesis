## Summary

This dissertation consists in theoretical and data analytic work centered around
estimation and inference for causal effects defined via stochastic interventions
in complex settings. Extensions are provided for causal mediation analysis,
corrections for two-phase sampling for application in vaccine efficacy trials,
time-to-event outcomes, and nonparametric conditional density estimation.
