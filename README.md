## Summary

My PhD dissertation.

This repository is for archival purposes. If you'd like to build the PDF
yourself (why!?), then you will find all of the necessary files within this
repository. I haven't yet included the necessary files to reproduce the data
analyses and simulation studies discussed in the document (just the results are
available); ~~I may get around to fixing this up once I've returned from a
much-needed vacation~~ I have no immediate plans to fix this.

__The dissertation document (in PDF) is available for browsing
[here](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/~nhejazi/publications/dissertation-phd-biostat.pdf).__
