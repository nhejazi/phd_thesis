\chapter{Future Directions}\label{six}

While the presented body of work has provided novel statistical methodology for
working with stochastic treatment regimes, there is yet much more to do. To
motivate future efforts, there is demand for the development of theory, methods,
and software for (1) higher-order efficient estimation of novel causal effects,
including (in)direct effects; and (2) generalizable, nonparametric estimation of
flexible, path-specific causal effects for time-to-event outcomes and
outcome-dependent sampling. Through an established collaborative network, these
developments will be guided by scientific necessity and applied in analyzing
Phase III COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials.

\section{Where Can We Go From Here?}

Over the last century, a new science of causality, ushered in by the foundations
of statistics, has emerged. Today, causal inference lies at the heart of
questions of science, policy, and medicine, What, if any, nutritional
interventions are most effective in promoting child growth and inhibiting
wasting in at-risk regions? such as determining which immunobiological pathways
mediate the action mechanism by which a candidate vaccine reduces infection
risk. By what mechanistic pathways does a novel therapeutic mitigate the risk of
substance abuse disorder relapse? What immunobiological pathways mediate the
action mechanism by which a candidate vaccine reduces infection risk? While
randomization, which enforces balance across treatment groups on average,
remains the ``gold standard'' for elucidating causal questions, randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) can be costly and constrained by ethics and
practicality (e.g., individuals cannot be forced to vaccinate). Consequently,
science has turned increasingly to observational studies, necessitating the
development of robust statistical methods for causal effect estimation and
uncertainty quantification, subject to the complications arising in the absence
of randomization. Even in RCTs, answering complex causal questions, such as
those concerning path-specific effects, requires posing causal models akin to
those used for observational studies.

Fueled by the deluge of ``Big Data'' amassed across collaborative research
networks, observational studies arm today's scientists with the means to
investigate elaborate, albeit daunting, questions. Fortunately, formal causal
inference frameworks outline tools for expressing such questions in terms of
hypothetical interventions and complex \textit{path-specific}
effects~\citep{pearl2000causality,hernan2020causal}. Consider, for example,
efficacy trials to evaluate candidate preventive vaccines for COVID-19; the
observed data are a sample of random variables $X$, with distribution $P_0$,
where $X = (L, A, Z, M, Y)$ consists of baseline covariates $L$ (e.g., age, sex,
co-morbidities), randomized vaccine v.~placebo assignment $A$, mediating
immunologic biomarkers such as binding or neutralizing antibody levels $M$,
mediator-outcome confounders affected by treatment $Z$ (e.g., post-vaccination
risky behavior), and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection $Y$. Two distinct pathways
reveal the direct and indirect effects~\citep{vanderweele2015explanation} of
vaccination: (1) $A \rightarrow Y$, and (2) $A \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y$ for
the partial effect through immunologic biomarkers. Causal inference empowers us
to investigate how disease risk \textit{would have changed} under counterfactual
treatment regimens, defined by interventions setting $A = a$ to $a^{\star} \in
\mathcal{A}$, that propagate to mediators $M$ to yield $M(a^{\star}) \in
\mathcal{M}$. These counterfactual random variables (i.e., $a^{\star}$ and
$M(a^{\star})$), with distribution $P_0^{\star}$, may be used to define highly
interpretable causal estimands $\psi_0^{\star} = \psi(P_0^{\star})$ --- for
example, the natural indirect effect $\psi_0^{\star}
= \mathbb{E}[Y(M(a^{\star}), a^{\star}) - Y(M(a),
a^{\star})]$~\citep{robins1992identifiability}, quantifying the causal impact of
vaccination on disease risk \textit{mediated only through} the immunologic
biomarkers $M$.

Although observational studies have led to a renaissance in statistical causal
inference, many significant challenges remain: causal estimands can be
``unidentifiable'' (i.e., learning $\psi(P_0^{\star})$ may be impossible from
observed data $X$), under even mildly non-standard conditions; unfounded
parametric assumptions can cause estimation bias, leading to questionable
conclusions; and, estimation of the statistical parameter $\psi(P)$ may be
complicated by biased sampling and high-dimensional or longitudinal data. Even
effect definitions can prove limiting: mediation analysis has focused on natural
(in)direct effects, whose identification assumptions preclude intermediate
confounding by $Z$~\citep{petersen2006estimation, tchetgen2014identification,
miles2017partial, vanderweele2017mediation}. While data adaptive regression may
address parametric model estimation bias, its use necessitates augmented
estimators~\citep{pfanzagl1985contributions, vdl2011targeted, vdl2018targeted,
coyle2020targeted} and mathematically intricate
derivations~\citep{carone2018higher} on a case-by-case basis for novel causal
estimands, motivating the dissemination of robust statistical software.
Real-world study designs, such as outcome-dependent two-phase sampling (the norm
in immunologic biomarker correlates analyses~\citep{haynes2012immune}), require
substantial corrections to ensure efficient effect
estimation~\citep{hejazi2020efficient} and extensions for complex (e.g.,
possibly right-censored time-to-event) outcomes.

Vaccine efficacy trials present unlimited yet pressing challenges, from a dire
need for path-specific causal estimands robustly identifiable and estimable with
right-censored mediators and outcomes to efficiency theory for estimation under
novel two-phase sampling designs.

%Fred Hutch statisticians often see randomized studies in which scientists try
%to make comparisons between nonrandomized subgroups of patients --- and that
%can be a problem. For example, say a study is pulling out and comparing the
%quality of life of survivors a year out from experimental treatment. If half of
%patients on Treatment A survive to one year but only a tiny fraction of
%patients on Treatment B do, unknown factors may be driving any observed
%differences in quality of life between the survivor groups. Maybe the few
%survivors of Treatment B are unusually hearty, so that anything notable in
%their quality of life is due to that underlying heartiness rather than the
%treatment they received.

Grounding future research efforts, we briefly review the methodological
contributions made thus far, which have leveraged advances in
non/semi-parametric causal inference to develop improved statistical estimation
techniques as well as new effect definitions extending causal inference
approaches to non-standard yet real-world settings.

\section{Nonparametric-efficient Estimation and Corrections for Two-phase
  Sampling}

Despite significant strides in statistical causal inference with the development
of multiply robust non/semi-parametric techniques (e.g., double machine
learning~\citep{chernozhukov2017double, chernozhukov2018double}, targeted
minimum loss estimation~\citep{vdl2006targeted, vdl2011targeted,
vdl2018targeted}), classical procedures such as inverse probability weighting
(IPW)~\citep{horvitz1952generalization, rosenbaum1983central, hernan2020causal}
remain widely used for their ease of implementation across a diversity of
settings~\citep{hernan2020causal}. Though straightforward, IPW estimators
require consistent estimation of a re-weighting mechanism $\pi_0(A \mid L)$,
used to induce balance on $A$. Estimates $\pi_n(A \mid L)$ are usually obtained
via finite-dimensional parametric models, a practice prone to biasing estimates
through model misspecification. While machine learning provides a potential
solution, most approaches are inconsistent with efficiency theory, which
requires a fast convergence rate ($1/\sqrt[4]{n}$) of the estimate to the true
mechanism (typically unattainable by machine learning). We have formulated
a novel class of IPW estimators~\citep{ertefaie2020nonparametric} by coupling
a recent machine learning algorithm (the highly adaptive
lasso~\citep{benkeser2016highly, vdl2017generally, bibaut2019fast,
hejazi2020hal9001}) with sieve-based selection strategies to achieve guarantees
of consistency and non/semi-parametric efficiency without sacrificing flexible
estimation of $\pi_n(A \mid L)$. Our work is the first demonstration that IPW
estimators can successfully incorporate flexible modeling without compromising
asymptotic bias or variance, outlining numerous avenues for future
investigation.

While non/semi-parametric causal inference can provide interpretable estimands,
their estimation is often complicated by thorny challenges posed by complex
study designs. For example, immune correlates analyses of vaccine efficacy
trials commonly use outcome-dependent two-phase
sampling~\citep{haynes2012immune}, in which immunologic biomarkers are measured
on a subset of study participants based on outcome status (e.g., infection) and
on demographic characteristics, severely complicating the statistical estimation
problem. \citet{janes2017higher} followed just such a design in providing the
first immune correlates analysis of the HIV Vaccine Trial Network 505 preventive
HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trial~\citep{hammer2013efficacy}. Seeking to quantify the
causal impact of post-vaccination antibody and T-cell immunologic biomarkers on
the risk of HIV-1 infection, in~\citet{hejazi2020efficient}, we fused two
disparate literatures on (1) stochastic
interventions~\citep{stock1989nonparametric,diaz2012population}, to adopt
a counterfactual framework applicable to continuous-valued immunologic
biomarkers, and (2) non/semi-parametric efficiency for two-phase
designs~\citep{breslow2003large,rose2011targeted2sd}, to generalize our causal
effect estimates beyond the second-phase sample.
%\peter{always use ``phase'' not ``stage'' (just a convention in the field)}
Our approach allowed for the mean counterfactual HIV-1 infection risk in the 505
trial to be quantified under hypothetical shifts in the observed immunologic
biomarker profile. We developed non/semi-parametric estimators of such causal
effect estimands, with guarantees of efficiency and multiple robustness despite
two-phase sampling. Using marginal structural
models~\citep{neugebauer2007nonparametric}, we formulated a dose-response
analysis strategy for summarizing the effects of shifting immunogenicity along
a pre-specified grid, providing a variable importance measure for ranking
immunologic biomarkers as study endpoints in future vaccine trials.

\section{Robust and Efficient Causal Mediation Analysis for Complex
  Path-specific Effects}

While interest in path-specific effects dates back to the work
of~\citet{wright1934method}, causal mediation analysis came into its modern form
only with the definition and identifiability of the natural (in)direct
effects~\citep{robins1992identifiability, pearl2001direct}. Though the natural
(in)direct effects were significant advances, they face several limitations:
they cannot accommodate continuous-valued treatments (i.e., $A \in \{0, 1\}$);
they are defined by \textit{static} interventions, which deterministically set
$A$ to a fixed value $a$ in its support $\mathcal{A}$; their identification
requires a restriction on ``cross-world'' counterfactuals of the mediators $M$,
which is incompatible with randomization; and they are unidentifiable in the
presence of mediator-outcome confounders $Z$ affected by treatment $A$
(``intermediate confounders''). All this significantly limits the scope of
application of these canonical causal effects. To combat these shortcomings, we
developed, in~\citet{diaz2020causal}, a path-specific decomposition of the
population intervention effect~\citep{diaz2012population} of flexible,
stochastic interventions~\citep{stock1989nonparametric, diaz2013assessing,
kennedy2019nonparametric}, accommodating multivariate $M$ and applicable to
categorical or continuous $A$. Our novel (in)direct effects do not require any
cross-world counterfactual independencies, allowing for their implications to be
rigorously tested in RCTs. We outlined modern, multiply robust estimators of our
(in)direct effects (implemented in our open source \texttt{medshift} software
package~\citep{hejazi-gh-medshift}), alongside corresponding non/semi-parametric
efficiency theory.

Though our developments laid the foundations of a new, general framework for
causal mediation analysis, our (in)direct effects, like their natural effect
counterparts, could not accommodate intermediate confounders $Z$, motivating
work on ``interventional'' (in)direct effects~\citep{diaz2020nonparametric,
hejazi2020nonparametric}. Inteventional (in)direct
effects~\citep{vanderweele2014effect, vansteelandt2017interventional} are a new
class of causal estimands utilizing joint static and stochastic interventions
(to $A$ and $M$, respectively) to remain identifiable under intermediate
confounding. In our initial contribution to the literature on interventional
effects, we provided the first detailed developments of efficiency theory and
non/semi-parametric efficient estimators for existing interventional (in)direct
effects~\citep{diaz2020nonparametric} (and the first open source software
package, \texttt{medoutcon}, for their application~\citep{hejazi-gh-medoutcon}).
We then expanded upon our new mediation analysis framework by defining the
\textit{stochastic} interventional (in)direct
effects~\citep{hejazi2020nonparametric}, applicable to categorical or continuous
$A$ and identifiable under less restrictive assumptions than their classical
counterparts. It remains to generalize such effects to accommodate censored
mediators and (possibly time-to-event) outcomes.

\section{Higher-order Efficiency for Estimation of Novel Causal Effects}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

  \item Theoretical development and evaluation of novel higher-order efficient
    estimators based on targeted undersmoothing with the highly adaptive lasso
    nonparametric regression function.
  \item Higher-order efficient estimators of the causal (in)direct effects of
    stochastic interventions.
  \item Motivated by immune correlates analyses of COVID-19 and HIV-1 vaccine
    efficacy trials, develop techniques for higher-order efficient estimation
    under two-phase sampling designs.
\end{enumerate}

Higher-order efficient estimation of the complex statistical functionals arising
in non/semi-parametric causal inference is an area largely undeveloped, though
the first steps advancing this research program are slowly being
taken~\citep{robins2008higher,carone2018higher}. Such techniques are desirable
for the fact that they expand the nuisance parameter configurations under which
multiply robust estimators may attain the non/semi-parametric efficiency bound.
In our work constructing nonparametric-efficient IPW
estimators~\citep{ertefaie2020nonparametric}, we demonstrated that a targeted
undersmoothing approach based on the highly adaptive lasso (HAL) could solve
a critical component of the estimating equation implied by the efficient
influence function (EIF), $D^{\star}$. A significant step in developing this
family of approaches for higher-order efficient estimation requires deriving
second-order remainder terms $R_2(P, P_0)$ of the EIF Taylor expansion, for
example, in problems with flexible stochastic interventions on the treatment
$A$ and/or of complex causal (in)direct effect estimands. The formulation of
a unique targeted undersmoothing approach to construct HAL nuisance parameter
estimators solving the EIF estimating equation $D^{\star}$ and remainder
$R_2(P, P_0)$ would constitute a generalizable strategy for higher-order
estimation without reliance on specialized knowledge beyond standard
non/semi-parametric efficiency theory, a significant step past similar recent
developments~\citep{vdl2017generally, benkeser2017doubly}. Like related
approaches, our estimators would be equipped with multiply robust confidence
intervals, allowing for valid, efficient statistical inference even under
nuisance parameter misspecification. Extending our undersmoothing approach to
the augmented EIFs implied by outcome-dependent two-phase sampling corrections
would allow our higher-order estimators to be applied in statistical analyses of
immune correlates in vaccine efficacy trials, through our ongoing collaborations
with the COVID-19 Prevention Trials and HIV Vaccine Trials Networks.

\section{Nonparametric Causal Inference for Path-specific Effects in Complex
  Settings}

  \item Outlining novel decompositions of (in)direct causal effects and their
    efficient estimation in settings with possibly right-censored time-to-event
    outcomes and two-phase sampling.
  \item Formulating and developing novel causal inference transport methodology

     open source software for their adoption.
  %\item Formulation of novel direct and indirect effects of stochastic
    %interventions on exposures and mediators based on path decompositions
    %involving intermediate confounders.
\end{enumerate}

Biomedical and health studies, vaccine efficacy trials especially, are often
complicated by time-to-event outcomes and outcome-dependent two-phase
sampling~\citep{follmann2006augmented} (e.g.,
case-cohort~\citep{prentice1986case, barlow1999analysis, mcelrath2008hiv}).
A common goal is to ascertain the effect of a treatment, through mediating
variables, on the occurrence of a possibly right-censored time-to-event outcome.
For example, in immune correlates analyses of vaccine
trials~\citep{haynes2012immune}, the observed data are random variables $X =
(L, A, Z, M, \Delta, \widetilde{T})$, where $\widetilde{T} = \min(T, C)$ for
failure time $T$ and censoring time $C$ with $\Delta = \mathbb{I}(T \leq C)$
indicating observed failure (other variables remain as previously defined). To
assess the indirect effect of vaccination $A$ through immunologic biomarkers
$M$, two innovations are necessary: (1) new path-specific effects identifiable
under intermediate confounding and capable of handling time-to-event outcomes,
and (2) efficient estimation strategies for outcome-dependent two-phase sampling
based on $\widetilde{T}$. For (1), we have proposed flexible (in)direct effect
estimands~\citep{diaz2020causal, hejazi2020nonparametric}, robust to
intermediate confounding; however, our (in)direct effects accommodate neither
time-to-event outcomes nor censoring. The study of (in)direct effect estimands
under such conditions is in its infancy: current
strategies~\citep[e.g.,][]{tchetgen2011causal, zheng2017longitudinal} break down
under intermediate confounding or are limited to binary treatments $A \in \{0,
1\}$. For (2), current methods construct second-phase samples based on $\Delta$
rather than $\widetilde{T}$, a limitation ignoring the time-to-event nature of
the outcome process and constraining sampling efficiency. Generalizing
(in)direct effect estimands necessitates methods for bridging estimates to new
populations (i.e., external validity); such \textit{causal transport}
techniques~\citep{pearl2011transportability, pearl2014external,
bareinboim2016causal} are under study but variants for
path-specific effects~\citep[e.g.,][]{rudolph2020efficiently}
are in a nascent stage. We will complement our theoretical and methodological
pursuits by developing and disseminating open source statistical software and
with the application of these approaches in immune correlates analyses of Phase
III vaccine trials through our collaborative role in the COVID-19 Prevention
Trials Network.

%Data structure for time-to-event outcomes under two-phase sampling for Covid-19

%effects through the immune correlate under complex censoring structure. $T$ is
%the time-to-event for symptomatic Covid-19 infection.

\section{Broader Significance and Impact of Future Work}

Since path-specific causal effects are ideal for developing scientific answers
to questions of mechanism, my proposed research program will have important
bearings on problems across many fields, from epidemiology and medicine to
economics and psychology. In the health and medical sciences, where the
measurement of important but costly variables (e.g., immunologic biomarkers)
complicates effect estimation, sophisticated methods for handling
outcome-dependent two-phase sampling, a key tool in scientific trial design, are
sorely needed. I am particularly motivated by avenues for formulating (in)direct
effects applicable to complex data from vaccine efficacy trials and will
leverage my collaborations with the COVID-19 Prevention Trials and HIV Vaccine
Trials Networks to inform scientifically impactful open problems in causal
inference. In turn, the methods we develop will help to maximize what we can
learn about critical and timely scientific questions, such as how best to tailor
future vaccines to mitigate infection risk.
