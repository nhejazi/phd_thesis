Nearly a century ago, the foundations of modern statistics laid the groundwork
for a science of causality. Today, causal inference is central to the study of
the most impactful questions at the intersection of science and policy: By what
mechanisms do novel therapeutics mitigate relapse in addiction disorders? How do
immunobiological markers mediate action mechanisms of vaccines? While
randomization provides ``gold standard'' tools for quantifying causal effects,
such trials are costly and limit the scope of scientific inquiry. Thus,
techniques for statistical causal inference with complex, observational data are
critical to today's, and tomorrow's, scientific endeavors.

Observational studies obviate many of the shortcomings of randomized trials but
bring their own challenges and promises. Without randomization, causal inference
is plagued by confounding: vaccinees may be more likely to engage in risky
behaviors and patients assigned a candidate therapeutic are not uniformly
``treated'' due to clinician heterogeneity. Adjusting for potential confounders
is a daunting challenge in an era where studies routinely measure numerous
high-dimensional, longitudinal characteristics. Further, observational studies
empower scientists to assess mechanistic, path-specific causal effects that
\textit{cannot be learned} with randomized data. Tools from non/semi-parametric
statistical theory and machine learning are needed to avoid imposing unrealistic
statistical assumptions, and novel causal effect estimands are required to
better address mechanistic questions.

Causal inference methodology is critical to answering real-world scientific
questions, but traditional approaches make too many simplifying assumptions. By
ignoring biased sampling designs, continuous-valued treatments, and confounding
of path-specific effects, standard statistical methods fall far short of
empowering mechanistic discovery. Such techniques often require \textit{a
priori} modeling assumptions unsupported by domain knowledge, limiting their
utility for real-world data analysis efforts.

This dissertation extends theory and methods for non/semi-parametric causal
inference in settings with continuous treatments, with particular attention paid
to issues emerging from biased sampling designs and path-specific causal
effects. \textit{Stochastic treatment regimes} provide a unifying framework for
formalizing such causal inference problems. Chapter~\ref{one} considers
estimation of the generalized propensity score, a quantity critical to
estimating the causal effects of stochastic interventions. To tractably estimate
this challenging quantity, we formulate algorithms for its flexible estimation
using the highly adaptive lasso, a nonparametric regression estimator. We then
develop a novel inverse probability weighted estimator of the causal effect of
a stochastic intervention, and show it capable of achieving the
non/semi-parametric efficiency bound. Chapter~\ref{two} focuses on the
application of the causal effects of stochastic interventions in real-world
studies that rely upon outcome-dependent two-phase sampling (e.g., case-cohort
designs). The work includes a methodological advance that unites techniques for
estimating the causal effects of stochastic interventions with corrections for
biased sampling, allowing for these complex causal parameters to be efficiently
estimated under such designs. Motivated by the aims of an HIV vaccine efficacy
trial, this contribution allows researchers to probe how the vaccination-induced
immunogenicity of candidate immune correlates of protection may best be
modulated by future vaccines, and the proposed methodology is demonstrated
through a re-analysis of the data from this trial. The COVID-19 pandemic took
the world by storm during the final year of this work, and Chapter~\ref{three}
generalizes the methodology proposed in Chapter~\ref{two} to help maximize what
can be learned from the critical and timely scientific inquiries posed by
COVID-19 vaccine trials. Chapter~\ref{four} examines path-specific causal
effects (i.e., causal mediation analysis), formulated based upon stochastic
interventions, introducing a new class of direct and indirect effect parameters
robust to intermediate confounding. Developing non/semi-parametric efficient
techniques for the flexible estimation of these path-specific effects,
facilitates their use in quantifying mechanistic knowledge and extracting
actionable insights from modern, large-scale studies. Chapter~\ref{five}
discusses open source software packages for causal inference, which implement
the statistical methodology discussed prior. Chapter~\ref{six} concludes with
a discussion of avenues that may motivate future research.
