Several remarkably skilled and dedicated mentors shaped this work. First and
foremost, I wish to thank Mark van der Laan for being an unrivaled advisor and
an inspirational collaborator. Mark's outstanding guidance, tireless support,
and vast patience made this work possible. His creativity, enthusiasm, and
generosity made working with him a great pleasure. It has been a privilege to
learn statistics from Mark, and I hope that our years working closely together
have instilled in me the fundamentals of Mark's remarkably well-structured
approach to problem solving. I owe my first experiences in applied biostatistics
research to Alan Hubbard, who gave me the opportunity to explore the intricate
intersection of applied statistics, computational biology, and bioinformatics.
Nick Jewell spent his time in teaching me about survival analysis and its
fascinating applications, and shared with me his seasoned perspective on our
field and its history.

I have also benefited considerably from the efforts of researchers in the
earlier stages of their careers. During the first year of my graduate studies,
I luckily crossed paths with David Benkeser, whose work on statistical methods
in vaccine trials captivated me. I quickly found in David a dedicated and
patient mentor to whom I owe many of the skills and much of the knowledge that
I rely upon daily. In turn, David embraced my then-nascent interests in
reproducible research and statistical software design.
%Our work appears in the second, third, and fifth chapters of this dissertation.
A few years later, I met Iv\'{a}n D\'{i}az, whose emerging interests in causal
mediation analysis led to an unpredictably fruitful collaboration. I have
learned a great deal from watching Iv\'{a}n's exemplary skills in causal
inference and statistical theory in action.
%Parts of our work formed the fourth and fifth chapters of this dissertation.
I eagerly look forward to postdoctoral training and longstanding collaborations
with David and Iv\'{a}n both.

Over the years, conversations and courses with Fernando P{\'e}rez, Jarrod
Millman, Philip Stark, and Sandrine Dudoit sparked the embers of my interests in
developing open source software for statistics and in the need for standards of
reproducible research in the computational sciences.
%Their influential examples showed me that these important ideas can have
%a tremendous impact on the transparency of science.

A few truly amazing individuals --- close colleagues and friends --- stand out
from across the recent years. I have grown immensely from numerous deep and
interesting conversations with Rachael Phillips, Ivana Malenica, and Jeremy
Coyle. Together, we built the earliest version of the \texttt{tlverse} software
ecosystem, delivered well-received workshops and short courses, and nearly
completed a book. Our work has been richly rewarding, and, better still, we even
found some time for fun along the way. I will recall our adventures fondly.
