My academic life has been blessed with many skilled teachers and mentors. I have
no doubt that their guidance, collectively, shepherded this work, and the many
lesser challenges that preceded it, from the realm of the insurmountable to that
of the achievable. Among them, several have invested a remarkable effort in the
period marked by the conclusion of this work. First and foremost, I wish to
thank Mark van der Laan for being an unrivaled advisor and an inspirational
collaborator. Mark's outstanding guidance, tireless support, and incredible
patience made this work possible, and his creativity and generosity made working
with him a great pleasure. I hope our time working closely together has
instilled in me the fundamentals of his structured and general approach to
problem solving. My first experiences in biostatistical research I owe to Alan
Hubbard, who gave a then-unexperienced student the opportunity to explore the
intricacies of real-world applied statistics. Nick Jewell spent his time in
teaching me about classical survival analysis and its applications, and shared
with me his seasoned perspective on our field and its history.

I have benefited enormously from the efforts of researchers in the earlier
stages of their careers too. Early in my studies, I luckily crossed paths with
David Benkeser, whose work on statistical methods in vaccine trials captivated
me. I quickly found in David a dedicated mentor to whom I owe many of the skills
and much of the knowledge that I rely upon daily. In turn, David embraced my
nascent interests in reproducible research and statistical software design. Our
work appears in the second, third, and fifth chapters of this dissertation.
A few years into my graduate studies, I met Iv\'{a}n D\'{i}az, whose emerging
interests in causal mediation analysis led to an unpredictably fruitful
collaboration. I have learned a great deal from watching Iv\'{a}n's skills in
causal inference and statistical theory in action. Parts of our work formed the
fourth and fifth chapters of this dissertation. I look forward to postdoctoral
training and longstanding research collaborations with David and Iv\'{a}n both.

Conversations and well-taught courses with Fernando P{\'e}rez, Jarrod Millman,
Philip Stark, and Sandrine Dudoit sparked the embers of my interests in the
design of open source software for statistics and in reproducibility standards
for the computational sciences. Their influential examples showed me that these
important ideas could serve me well as core aspects my personal research
philosophy and my greater research agenda.

Often, only upon reflection do we realize how much we have learned from our
colleagues and friends. A few truly amazing individuals stand out from my time
in graduate school. I have grown immensely from numerous deep and interesting
conversations with Rachael Phillips, Ivana Malenica, and Jeremy Coyle. Our work
together has been richly rewarding, and we even found some time for fun along
the way.
